# Dataset 3: U.S. Presidential Election History

# This still looks terrible. You could continue to mess around with values for hjust and get there eventually. Instead, let's call up a new package and explore how to add better labels to plots using a new dataset

# Now, uncomment the geom_text_repel() above and replot. See what happens to the labels if you adjust the size of your plot window in RStudio. 

# It's messy, but all points are labeled without tremendous overlaps. For this plot, we might be more interested in how far away each point is from the 50% threshold on both axis, or in the outcome of a particular election. So, it might make more sense to pick out points of interest in the data instead of labelling every single point. And this is where geom_text_repel() is powerful.
